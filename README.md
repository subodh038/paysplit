💸 PaySplit — Decentralized Group Payments on Solana

PaySplit is a decentralized app that lets friends, roommates, and communities easily split and settle shared expenses — for rent, food, movies, trips, or anything else.
Built on Solana, PaySplit uses smart escrow contracts to handle funds securely and automatically release payments once everyone contributes their share.

🚀 Key Features
👥 Create & Split Bills

Create a new split (e.g. Dinner, Rent, Movie Night)

Add participants and define each share

💳 Pay Using Solana Wallet

Connect your wallet (e.g. Phantom or Solflare)

Pay your share using SOL or USDC

Payments are handled directly on-chain

🔒 Automatic Escrow & Release

Funds stay in escrow until all participants have paid

Once everyone completes payment, funds are automatically released to the owner’s wallet

No manual intervention or trust needed

Every transaction and status update is recorded

Users can view their completed, pending, or cancelled splits
